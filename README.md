# To-do-List
A cool and simple To-do list made with React and Typescript.

The purpose was to practice basic concepts related to states and props in React environment with typescript.
The list of items makes use of dictionary and localStorage, converting the dictionary into JSON format to be
stored in order to keep all the entries from user in his/her browser.
It was also an opportunity to review interface concepts!
